Py Rollers Casino

Py Rollers Casino is a group Pygame project focused on creating a collection of casino mini-games. All project materials are in the public domain (CC-0), so any contributions must follow the same licensing.

Project Goals

Give people experience working together on a project

Use GitHub’s collaborative features

Create something that people of all experience levels can contribute to

Provide card, dice, and chip modules that can be used in other games

Make decisions by consensus whenever possible

How to Get Involved
Make a Game:

Pick any mini-game that isn’t already being worked on, or propose your own. Try to ensure there is only one version of each game, except for slot machines. Add your name to the participant list and start coding.

Code Review:

If you have limited time but plenty of experience, you can review the code and suggest improvements. You can make changes via pull requests or discuss suggestions with other contributors.

Testing:

The project always needs testers. Play the mini-games, look for bugs, and report them with as much detail as possible: what happened, the traceback if any, your operating system, and Python version.
